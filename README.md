# FitPy

FitPy is an open-source library to fit data in science and engineering.  
In addition to the linear least squares method provided by other libraries, it also support fitting nonlinear models.
Histograms can be fitted using the provided Poisson likelihood interface.

FitPy is used to calculate the estimators of the fit parameters, their errors, and evaluate the goodness-of-fit with a chi-squared test.
It also facilitates the plotting of error bands, confidence ellipses, and likelihood functions.

FitPy provides a simple yet fairly complete interface to fit data with rather compact Python programs. 
We provide some examples about using FitPy in [some examples about using FitPy](examples)
